Runiac is a development tool for running infrastructure as code such as Terraform and ARM Templates. Runiac is designed from the ground up for you to spend more time improving your app by letting runiac handle the busy work of automating infrastucture development.

Once you have runiac installed, run any iac with `runiac deploy`:

<TerminalTabs></TerminalTabs>

Runiac's primary feature is enabling easy, meaningful local development that mimics a production deployment.  
This enables two large benefits:

- Changes can be tested quickly and reliably in a cloud environment from a local machine
- Each local run verifies the pipeline because they use the same `runiac deploy` command

Early adopters have seen a 200% productivity increase in iac development from these simple benefits!

<!-- > runiac core is meant to be run within an image. We do **not** recommend running the `runiac` core binary in another image, as it might not work.
