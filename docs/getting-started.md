## Step 1: Pull down the runaic examples

The examples are in the same repository as the runiac source code.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Optum/runiac.git
```

## Step 2: Choose your example

Run the development server in the newly created `my-website` folder:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Open `docs/getting-started.md` and edit some lines. The site reloads automatically and display your changes.

## That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your Docusaurus project.
